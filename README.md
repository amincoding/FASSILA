# Arabic Language Analysis

This Python script performs analysis on Arabic language text data, including counting Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) words, determining vocabulary size, and counting Latin characters.

## Setup

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas

### Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your_username/arabic-language-analysis.git
cd arabic-language-analysis

path = "path/to/your/msa_dataset.csv"
path2 = "path/to/your/latin_dataset.csv"

python analyze_arabic.py


Replace `"path/to/your/msa_dataset.csv"` and `"path/to/your/latin_dataset.csv"` with the actual file paths to your MSA and Latin datasets. Also, make sure to name your Python script accordingly (e.g., `analyze_arabic.py`).
